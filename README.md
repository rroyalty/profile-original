# rroyalty.github.io (Homework #2 - Profile!)

## Description 

Well this one was much tougher than homework #1. This project certainly isn't perfect, but I've been working on it for hours and boy am I burnt out. 

The following is the README for the project rroyalty.github.io, which is the repository created for the second homework assignment of the UNH Bootcamp course. For the assignment, I was given the task of creating my very own digital profile. We were given the following examples to loosely recreate.

![Example finished site]

The HTML and CSS code was inefficiently organized and not very accessible to anybody who might be looking at the code. The assignment required us to refactor the code in such a way that it was much more user accessible, yet loaded a page nearly identical to the example provided.  

## Installation

The project is a website; no installation necessary.
